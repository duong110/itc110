1. What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them? 
True, False
2. What are the three Boolean operators? 
And, Or, not
3. Write out the truth tables of each Boolean operator (that is, every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what they evaluate to). 
 True and False = False
  True and True = True
  False and True = False
  False and False = False
  
  True or False = True
  False or True = True
  False or False = False
  True or True = True
  
  not True = False
  not False = True
4. What do the following expressions evaluate to?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5) : False
not (5 > 4) : False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5): True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) : False
(True and True) and (True == False): False
(not False) or (not True): True

5. What are the six comparison operators?
  == equal to
  != not equal to
  > greater than
  < less than
  <= less than or equal to
  >= greater than or equal to

6. What is the difference between the equal to operator and the assignment operator?
  == compares two values and returns true if they are the same
  = assigns a value to a variable

7. Explain what a condition is and where you would use one
    A condition is an expression that evaluates to a boolean value. You would use a condition in a flow control statement.

8. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10: 
  print('eggs')   first block
if spam > 5:        
  print('bacon')  second block
else:       
  print('ham')   third block
print('spam') 
print('spam')


9. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam. 
spam = 0
spam = input()
if spam == '1':
    print('Hello')
elif spam == '2':
    print('Howdy')
else:
    print('Greetings')

10. What can you press if your program is stuck in an infinite loop? 
[ctrl] + C
11. What is the difference between break and continue? 
 break: stop and jump out of a loop early.
 continue: skips a step and keeps going to the next line of code below it.
12. What is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop? 
  The difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1) in a for loop is the value increment.
13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop. 
With for loop:

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)

With while loop:

i = 0
while i < 10:
    i += 1
    print(i)
14. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
spam.bacon()

Extra credit: Look up the round() and abs() functions on the Internet, and find out what they do. Experiment with them in the interactive shell.
