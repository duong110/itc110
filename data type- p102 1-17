1. What is []? 
It is an empty list value,

2. How would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value in a list stored in a variable named spam? (Assume spam contains [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].)
For the following three questions, let’s say spam contains the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']. 
spam.insert(2, 'hello')


3. What does spam[int('3' * 2) / 11] evaluate to? 
 ['d']
 
4. What does spam[-1] evaluate to?
 ['d']
 
5. What does spam[:2] evaluate to?
For the following three questions, let’s say bacon contains the list  [3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True]. 
 ['a', 'b']
 
6. What does bacon.index('cat') evaluate to?
1

7. What does bacon.append(99) make the list value in bacon look like? 
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. What does bacon.remove('cat') make the list value in bacon look like?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True]

9. What are the operators for list concatenation and list replication? 
.concatenation is +
  replication is *
  
10. What is the difference between the append() and insert() list methods? 
append adds whatevers in the argument to the end of the list
   insert() inserts a value anywhere in the list, the first argument is
   the index to insert to, the second argument is what to insert
   
11. What are two ways to remove values from a list?
The del statement
  remove()
  
12. Name a few ways that list values are similar to string values. 
you can both index them, slice them, put them in a stew, use them in for loops, use them in
len().

13. What is the difference between lists and tuples? 
Lists are mutable; they can be altered and use brackets[] but, 
Tuples are immutable; they can never be changed, they use parentheses (). 
  
14. How do you type the tuple value that has just the integer value 42 in it?
 (42 ,)
 
15. How can you get the tuple form of a list value? How can you get the list form of a tuple value?
The tuple() and list() 

16. Variables that “contain” list values don’t actually contain lists directly. What do they contain instead? 
They contain references to the list values

17. What is the difference between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
The copy.copy() is a shallow copy of a list, whereas the copy.deepcopy() result in a deep copy of a list.copy.deepcopy()
is used if you value contains a list of lists, and you want to duplicate the lists inside your list.
