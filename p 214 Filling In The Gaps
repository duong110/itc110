Write a program that finds all files with a given prefix, such as spam001.txt,
spam002.txt, and so on, in a single folder and locates any gaps in the numbering
(such as if there is a spam001.txt and spam003.txt but no spam002.txt).
Have the program rename all the later files to close this gap.
As an added challenge, write another program that can insert gaps
into numbered files so that a new file can be added

import os, re

def atoi(text):
    return int(text) if text.isdigit() else text

def natural_keys(text):
    '''
    alist.sort(key=natural_keys) sorts in human order
    http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200712/human_sorting.html
    (See Toothy's implementation in the comments)
    '''
    return [ atoi(c) for c in re.split('(\d+)', text) ]

print('Enter folder you wish to work with, ending with a "\\" character.')
folder = input()
print('Enter the file prefix you would like to use: ')
filepre = input()
os.chdir(folder)

files = []
for filename in os.listdir(folder):
    files = files + [filename]
files.sort(key=natural_keys)
num = 0
for each in files:
    num = num + 1
    if len(each) - len(filepre) ==  5:
        suff = filepre + str(num) + '.txt'
    if len(each) - len(filepre) ==  6:
        suff = filepre + str(num) + '.txt'
    if len(each) - len(filepre) ==  7:
        suff = filepre + str(num) + '.txt'
    if not each == suff:
        os.rename(each, suff)
print('Done')
